Notes

The strategy on my python script (I'll add it later) is to:
1. run SU2_DEF with deformation cfg file
2. run direct case
3. run adjoint_cd
3.1 run su2_dot_ad for cd
4. run adjoint contraint 
4.1 run su2_dot_ad for constraint
5. go to 1.

To use these files check mesh file names and for su2_def check surface file name and mesh file name (should be original here) for deformation script.
